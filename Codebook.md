##Variables
From the dataset website (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#)  
For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
  - Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
  - Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
  - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
  - Its activity label. 
  - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

##Variable Names
(from the features_info.txt file provided with this data set)   
The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
  mean(): Mean value
  std(): Standard deviation
  mad(): Median absolute deviation 
  max(): Largest value in array
  min(): Smallest value in array
  sma(): Signal magnitude area
  energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
  iqr(): Interquartile range 
  entropy(): Signal entropy
  arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
  correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
  maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
  meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
  skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
  kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
  bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
  angle(): Angle between to vectors.  

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

  gravityMean
  tBodyAccMean
  tBodyAccJerkMean
  tBodyGyroMean
  tBodyGyroJerkMean
